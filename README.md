## Run tests

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of your project.

3. Write your tests and save them in a directory named **tests** or tests.
4. To run all tests, type the command jest in the terminal. Jest will automatically find and run all tests in the **tests** or tests directory.
5. If you want to run a specific test file or a specific set of tests, you can pass the file name or test name as an argument to the jest command. For example, to run test file named my-test-file.test.js, type the command jest my-test-file.test.js.
6. Jest will output the results of the tests to the terminal, showing which tests passed and which tests failed.
